### Getting Started
----
The setup assistant will launch once you turn the computer on. Enter your preferred language, time zone, Apple ID, and so on. The first thing you should do is update macOS to get the latest security updates and patches.

### Install HomeBrew 
----  
Install the Homebrew package manager. This will allow you to install almost any app from the command line.


```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```
Make sure everything is up to date.

```
brew upgrade
```

### Install Apps
----
| Shell Programs     | Purpose |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| [git](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-shell)| Version control |
| bat         | cat alternative |
| exa         | 	ls alternative       |
| [tldr](https://tldr.sh/) | man alternative      |

Here are some the applications I always install (cask flag in Homebrew):


**_NOTE:_** Do not install Node.js through Homebrew. Use nvm (below).

### Shell
Catalina comes with zsh as the default shell. Install Oh My Zsh for sensible defaults.Catalina comes with zsh as the default shell. Install Oh My Zsh for sensible defaults.

```
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

### Node.js
Use Node Version Manager (nvm) to install Node.js. This allows you to easily switch between Node versions, which is essential.

```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash
```


#### Install
I recommand using LTS  
```
nvm install --lts 
```
Restart terminal and run the final command.

```
nvm use node
```
Confirm that you are using the latest version of Node and npm.
```
node -v && npm -v
```

### Git

The first thing you should do with Git is [set your global configuration](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup).

```
touch ~/.gitconfig
```
Input your config and create some aliases.
```
[user]
  name   = Firstname Lastname
  email  = you@example.com
[github]
  user   = username
[alias]
  a      = add
  ca     = commit -a
  cam    = commit -am
  cm     = commit -m
  s      = status
  p      = push
  pom    = push origin master
  puom   = pull origin master
  cob    = checkout -b
  co     = checkout
  fp     = fetch --prune --all
  l      = log --oneline --decorate --graph
  lall   = log --oneline --decorate --graph --all
  ls     = log --oneline --decorate --graph --stat
  lt     = log --graph --decorate --pretty=format:'%C(yellow)%h%Creset%C(auto)%d%Creset %s %Cgreen(%cr) %C(bold blue)%an%Creset'
```
With the above aliases, I can run git s instead of git status, for example. The less I have to type, the happier I am.


### SSH

You can [generate an SSH key](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/) to distribute.

```
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```
Start ssh-agent.

eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
Add key.

```
ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

#### Config
Simplify the process of SSHing into other boxes with your SSH config file. Create ~/.ssh/config if it does not already exist.

Add the following contents, changing the variables for any hosts that you connect to. Using the below will be the same as running ssh -i ~/.ssh/key.pem user@example.com.

<mark>~/.ssh/config</mark>

```
Host *
  AddKeysToAgent yes
  UseKeychain yes
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

Host myssh
  HostName example.com
  User user
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/key.pem
```
Now just run the alias to connect.
```
ssh myssh
```
