### Getting Started
----
The setup assistant will launch once you turn the computer on. Enter your preferred language, time zone, Apple ID, and so on. The first thing you should do is update macOS to get the latest security updates and patches.

### Install HomeBrew 
----  
Install the Homebrew package manager. This will allow you to install almost any app from the command line.


```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```
Make sure everything is up to date.

```
brew upgrade
```
